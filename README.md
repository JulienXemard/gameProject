# SEI-49 | Project 1: Space Invader 

## Overview

The game aims to offer a unique immersive experience using:
<br/>
* Vanilla Javascript (ES6)
* CSS
* HTML5
<br/>

The technical brief (below) was to build an HTML game with CSS & Vanilla Javascript.
The list of games options were:
<br/>
* Battleship
* Connect 4
* Frogger
* Mastermind
* Pac-man
* Snake
* Tetris
* Space Invaders
<br/>

The reason I choose Space Invaders is due to the immersive experience I wanted to offer.<br/>
My researches allowed me to find a Javascript Starfield background that respected the brief and fitted my theme DNA.

## Technical brief

* **Render the game in the browser**
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* **Use Javascript for DOM manipulation**
* HTML Canvas is **not** to be used during this project.
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
