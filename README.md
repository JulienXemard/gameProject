* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* **Use Javascript for DOM manipulation**
* HTML Canvas is **not** to be used during this project.
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

## Overview

* The game is hosted [here](https://julienxemard.github.io/gameProject-1/)
* Else, kindly clone or fork the repository & open the index.html.

The list of games options were:
<br/>
* Battleship
* Connect 4
* Frogger
* Mastermind
* Pac-man
* Snake
* Tetris
* Space Invaders
<br/>

I chose Space Invaders as I wanted to create a different 2D | 3D immersive experience.<br/>
My researches led me to find a .js script background that perfectly fitted both the brief & my idea.<br/>

<br/>
With a month of coding experience, Space Invaders game logic was a tough yet interesting challenge.<br/>
The project allowed me to re-use all methods taught during our first month which also led me to realise the following statement:<br/>
<br/>

* It is one thing to understand it when an experienced programmer demonstrate & another to do it on your own.<br/>
<br/>
I realised that the frustration moments are the constant & that the solutions to them are intellectually rewarding.<br/>

## Game Instructions

**Player Controls**
* Use **A** to move **â¬…** & **D** to move **âž¡**<br/>
* Use **W** to move **â¬†** & **S** to move **â¬‡**<br/>
* Use **Space Bar** to kill them all ðŸ‘½!<br/>
<br/>

**Game Over Cases**
* If the enemy spaceships collide with yours<br/>
* If some enemy spaceships reach the surface<br/>
* If enemy lasers hit you 3 times<br/>
<br/>

**Game Win Case**
* If you eliminate all enemies within the given period<br/>
<br/>

Each scenarios will offer a restart option.

## Challenges

* The first difficulty was to figure out a way to initiate a movement pattern for each enemy.<br/>
* Some difficulties applying the loop to have all enemies shooting randomly as a lot of intervals are involved.
* The restart function could have been simplified if I would have better planned this project.

## Comments

**Any suggestions to improve my code will be studied meticulously**
